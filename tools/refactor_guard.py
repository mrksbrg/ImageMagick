"""Mechanically check that a refactor did not change behaviour-carrying tokens.

The refactoring campaign (docs/refactoring/) allows only structural changes:
extracting functions, adding guard clauses, naming predicates. None of those
may alter a numeric literal, a string, or a character constant.

This script extracts every literal from a file before and after a change and
compares the multisets. If a constant appeared, vanished, or changed value,
the refactor is not behaviour-preserving and must be reverted.

It is deliberately dumb and has no opinion about style. It answers exactly one
question: did any constant change?

Usage:
    python3 tools/refactor_guard.py MagickCore/gem.c          # working tree vs HEAD
    python3 tools/refactor_guard.py --base main MagickCore/gem.c
    python3 tools/refactor_guard.py --all                    # every changed .c/.cpp
    python3 tools/refactor_guard.py --combined --base HEAD MagickCore/gem.c MagickCore/new.c

Exit codes:
    0  no literal changed
    1  a literal changed, or the file could not be compared
